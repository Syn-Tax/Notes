*** The 4 Ps
- *Place* can be identified at a veriety of *scales* from local territories or locations to the national or statr level. They can be compared according to their cultural or physical diversity or disparities in wealth or resource endownment. The characteristics of a place may be real or percieved, and spatial interactions between places can be considered
  + *Characteristics* of a place (Social, economic, physical features, homogenous, diverse, urban, rural)
  + *Perception* of a place (safe, dangerous, exciting, home)
  + *Size* (village, town, neighbourhood, city, district, country)
  + *Connections* (infrastructure, development, similarities)
- *Processes* are human or physical mechanisms of change, such as migration or weathering. They operate on varying timescales. Linear systems, circular systems, and complex systems are all outcomes of the way in which processes operate and interact
  + *Change* caused by human or physical factors or both
  + *Temporal* Processes may be fast or slow, sporadic or consistent
  + *Systems* processes exist in different systems in the human and physical world: linear and circular, closed and open, requiring input and creating outputs
  + *Relationships* Processes can affect places at different scales via *spatial interaction*.
- *Power* is the ability to influence and affect change or equilibrium at different scales. Power is vested in citizens, governments, institutions and other players, and in physical processes in the natural world. Equty and security, botht environmental and economic, can be gained or lost as a result of the interaction of powerful forces
- *Possibilities* are the alternative events, futures, and outcomes that geographers can model, project or predict with varying degrees of certainty. Key contemporary questions include teh degree to which human and environmental systems are sustainable and resilient and can adapt or change
*** Primary Sector
- extraction of natural resources (labour intensive) i.e. farming, fishing
*** Secondary Sector
- Processing of natrual resources i.e. manufacturing
*** Tertiary Sector
- Providing services to customers i.e. schools, restaurants
*** Quarernary Sector
- the knowledge based economic sector i.e. IT, research, media
*** Informal sector
- unregulated usually illegal
- Doesn't count towards that countries GDP
** Don't Panic -- Hans Rosling showing the facts about population Notes :documentary:
- population grew slowly until 1800 where pop became 1 billion
- with the industrial revolution it rose exponentially to 2 billion in just 100 years
- then from 3 billion to 8 billion since 1950(ish)
- in Bangladesh they culturally have large families
- The culture is now shifting towards smaller families
- with fewer children per woman the life expectancy climbs
- In the developed countries there were smaller families and therewere longer lives
- the opposite was true for developing countries
- now there are fewer children per woman and the average life expectancy has therefore increased
- When the british public were asked about this only 12% got it right
- This is an example of the preocncieved ideas, however now 2 child families are the norm
- The government is now making sure that more girls stay in school for secondary education
- This seems to be working
- The big reason why this change is working is a huge increase in child survival
- Even in the slums women now mostly have two children
- Before 1800 most women had 6 children however the population didn't grow due to the fact that 4 died
- The big reason for rapid population growth is due to an increase in child survival
- in 2000 there were 2 billion children and it is predicted to stay similar for the rest of the centuary
- With this population growth it is resonable to assume that many will live in extreme poverty however many of the poorer countries's economies are booming however this is only for towns and cities (rural areas are becoming slowly better)
- the big thing for the rural poor is getting a bicycle due to faster and more efficient transportation they are therefore able to make more money
- Extreme poverty seems to perpetuate

****** Definition
Cities whose population is greater than 10 million
City defined as the administrative district of a city
**** What affects where people live?
***** Population density
[[https://i.imgur.com/IaRlRdS.png]]
****** Physical factors
These mostly have to do with the ability to grow food
******* Climate
- This would have to do with the climates required for efficient agriculture
- It is physical due to the fact that it cannot be controlled by humans
- It can be considered both an attrector if the climate of that particular area is favourable either for tourism or for agriculture or a deterrant if the climate is unfavourable
EG:
 - extreme drought
 - extreme cold
 - mild climates
******* Landscape
- The landscape will again have an impact on food production and on communications
EG:
 - moutinous
 - flat
 - grassland
 - forest
******* Resources
- This would mostly have an impact on the economic growth of a region as long as it has the technology to exploit those resources
EG:
 - Coal
 - Oil
 - Forest
******* Soil
- Mostly for agriculture again
EG:
 - soils good for agriculture
******* Vegetation
- affected by the landscape & climate, can affect which crops can be grown
******* Water
- potable vs non-potable water
- water for cooling industrial equipment
- transport
******* Accessibility
- mode and frequency of transport
****** Human factors
******* Government policies
******* Disease
******* Development
******* Culture
******* Comunication
**** How do we classify the world? (economic)
Economic classifications
- At it's most basic teh world can be divided into rich & poor
  + There is evidence to suggest that the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting relatively poorer
  + This method is still widely used in the media and by politicians & activists & categorized by the Brandt line or the North-South divide
- Another formerly common method of classification is as follows
  + *The First World* (developed): Western europe, North America, Australia, New Zealand & Japan
  + *The Second World*: state-controlled communist countries such as teh former Soviet Union
  + *The Third World*, or developing world: all other less developed countries
- A More detailed  way of classifying countries is as follows:
  + More economically developed countries (MEDC) such as the UK & USA
    These are the most developed countries and have a high standard of living. They are now referred to as high-income countries (HICs)
  + Newly Industrializing countries (NICs) such as South Korea & Taiwan
    These countries have experienced rapid economic growth since 1960. There are many catrgories of NICs, all showing rapid economic growth or potential for growth
    - BRICs - Brazil, Russia, India and China whi werre joined by South Africa in 2010 to form BRICS
    - MINT - Mexico, Indoneisa, Nigeria and Turkey
    - CIVETS - Columbia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Egypt, Turkey and South Africa
    - Next Eleven (N11) - Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, Turkey, South Korea and Vietnam -- countries that have potentially the currently fastest growing economies
    - Centrally planned economies (CPEs) such as North Korea or former USSR, these are socialist countries under strict governmental conrtol, many former communist countries remain in this category.
    - Oil-rich countries such as Saudi Arabia, High GNP per capita although not distributed evenly
  + Recently industrializing countries (RICs) shuch as Chile
**** Will the global population surpass 10 billion by 2100
- until now yes
- recent research shows it might actually start shrinking well before 2100
-
**** Sectors of industry
- LIC's primary industry is usually the primary sector
- MIC's usually have more of a balance between tertiary and the others
- HIC's usually have mostly tertiary industry
**** Core-Periphery Model
[[https://kognity-prod.imgix.net/media/edusys_2/content_uploads/1.1.6.2.48c8ea762abde28a3a91.png]]
- Developed by John Friedmann in 1963
- It had the intention of explaining spacial differences
- It can be applied to any scale: global, nationalor local
- The core is categorised by:
  + a well devloped prosperous area whith a sound economic base in secondary and tertiary industry
  + A wide range of services such as health care, education and communications
  + a good network of electricity, gas and water supplies
  + high literacy rates
  + centre for decision making
  + exports manufactured goods
  + davelopment of megacities as voluntary in-migration
  + high levels of foreign direct investment
  + good quality housing
  + cultural and racial diversity
  + large range of entertainment
- The periphery (and semi-periphery) is categorised by:
  + less developed
  + limited access to potable water, health care, electricity and education
  + limited access to markets
  + population growth tending to be higher
  + a lack of jobs that drives out-migration
  + resources moving from the periphery the core to support industrial growth
  + lower levels of literacy skills
**** Questions
***** Why does the author state that brexit will be a bad Idea?
Tibor Feher's argument is that "Brexit is an illogical move" due to work previously in the paper where he states that the core of Europe is about a 720km radius around Brussels, the 'capital of Europe'. The reason for this distance is that that is the distance one truck can cover in one working day without breaking EU regulations with an average speed of 90 km/h, any further and it would require either to stop the truck for multiple hours, another driver or violating the rules which all add to the cost
