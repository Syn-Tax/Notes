** Key Terms
*** North-South divide
The increasing inequality in levels of development between the North and the South or between HICs and LICs.
*** Development gap
The difference in wealth between the developed world (North) and the devloping world (south).
*** OPEC
The organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, representing the interests of oil exporters. Its position is undermined by some oil producing countries such as the UK, which does not agree with OPEC-controlled oil prices.
*** The G7/G8
A group of the world's wealthiest and most powerful countries.
*** The G10 or Paris Club
A group representing the wealthiest members of teh International Monetary Fund.
*** LIC
Standing for low income country defined as (as of 1 July 2019) those with an average GNI (Gross National Income) per capita of $1025 (UN defines as $1035) or below the previous year as defined by the World Bank Atlas (World Bank)
e.g. Afghanistan, Ghana
*** MIC
Middle Income Country
Lower middle - $1026-$3995 (World Bank), $1036-$4085 (UN)
Upper middle - $3996-$12375 (World Bank), $4086-$12615 (UN)
e.g. Brazil, China, Indoneisa
*** HIC
High income country
Above $12375 (World Bank), $12615 (UN)
e.g. Japan, Australia, The Netherlands
** Don't Panic -- Hans Rosling showing the facts about population Notes :documentary:
- population grew slowly until 1800 where pop became 1 billion
- with the industrial revolution it rose exponentially to 2 billion in just 100 years
- then from 3 billion to 8 billion since 1950(ish)
- in Bangladesh they culturally have large families
- The culture is now shifting towards smaller families
- with fewer children per woman the life expectancy climbs
- In the developed countries there were smaller families and therewere longer lives
- the opposite was true for developing countries
- now there are fewer children per woman and the average life expectancy has therefore increased
- When the british public were asked about this only 12% got it right
- This is an example of the preocncieved ideas, however now 2 child families are the norm
- The government is now making sure that more girls stay in school for secondary education
- This seems to be working
- The big reason why this change is working is a huge increase in child survival
- Even in the slums women now mostly have two children
- Before 1800 most women had 6 children however the population didn't grow due to the fact that 4 died
- The big reason for rapid population growth is due to an increase in child survival
- in 2000 there were 2 billion children and it is predicted to stay similar for the rest of the centuary
- With this population growth it is resonable to assume that many will live in extreme poverty however many of the poorer countries's economies are booming however this is only for towns and cities (rural areas are becoming slowly better)
- the big thing for the rural poor is getting a bicycle due to faster and more efficient transportation they are therefore able to make more money
- Extreme poverty seems to perpetuate

City defined as the administrative district of a city
**** What affects where people live?
***** Population density
[[https://i.imgur.com/IaRlRdS.png]]
****** Physical factors
These mostly have to do with the is the ability to grow food
******* Climate
- This would have to do with the climates required for efficient agriculture
- It is physical due to the fact that it cannot be controlled by humans
- It can be considered both an attrector if the climate of that particular area is favourable either for tourism or for agriculture or a deterrant if the climate is unfavourable
EG:
 - extreme drought
 - extreme cold
 - mild climates
******* Landscape
- The landscape will again have an impact on food production and on communications
EG:
 - moutinous
 - flat
 - grassland
 - forest
******* Resources
- This would mostly have an impact on the economic growth of a region as long as it has the technology to exploit those resources
EG:
 - Coal
 - Oil
 - Forest
******* Soils
- Mostly for agriculture again
EG:
 - soils good for agriculture
******* Vegetation
******* Water
******* Accessibility
****** Human factors
******* Government policies
******* Disease
******* Development
******* Culture
******* Comunication
