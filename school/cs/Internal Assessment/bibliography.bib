  abstract = {Essays are paramount for of assessing the academic excellence along with linking the different ideas with the ability to recall but are notably time consuming when they are assessed manually. Manual grading takes significant amount of evaluator's time and hence it is an expensive process. Automated grading if proven effective will not only reduce the time for assessment but comparing it with human scores will also make the score realistic. The project aims to develop an automated essay assessment system by use of machine learning techniques by classifying a corpus of textual entities into small number of discrete categories, corresponding to possible grades. Linear regression technique will be utilized for training the model along with making the use of various other classifications and clustering techniques. We intend to train classifiers on the training set, make it go through the downloaded dataset, and then measure performance our dataset by comparing the obtained values with the dataset values. We have implemented our model using java.},

  abstract = {In this modern age, where the world moves towards automation so, there is a need for automation in answer evaluation system. Currently, the online answer evaluation is available for mcq based question, hence evaluation of the theory answer is hectic for the checker. Teacher manually checks the answer and allot the marks. The current system takes more manpower and time to evaluate the answer. In this journal an application based on the evaluation of answers using machine learning. The objective of the journal is to specially reduce the manpower and time consumption. Since in manual answer evaluation, the manpower and the time consumption is much more. Also, in the manual system, it may be possible that the marks given to two same answers are different. This application system provides an automatic evaluation of answer based on the keyword provided to the application in form of the input by the moderator which will provide equal distribution of marks and will reduce time and manpower.},
