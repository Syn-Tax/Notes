  abstract = {In this modern age, where the world moves towards automation so, there is a need for automation in answer evaluation system. Currently, the online answer evaluation is available for mcq based question, hence evaluation of the theory answer is hectic for the checker. Teacher manually checks the answer and allot the marks. The current system takes more manpower and time to evaluate the answer. In this journal an application based on the evaluation of answers using machine learning. The objective of the journal is to specially reduce the manpower and time consumption. Since in manual answer evaluation, the manpower and the time consumption is much more. Also, in the manual system, it may be possible that the marks given to two same answers are different. This application system provides an automatic evaluation of answer based on the keyword provided to the application in form of the input by the moderator which will provide equal distribution of marks and will reduce time and manpower.},
