* Course Structure
- The course has a three part structure according to the three areas of exploration.
- No Assessment is tied to a particular part of the course so you can use any of the texts studied for any assessment (you cannot use the same work twice).
- The questions are very general which enables you to talk about whatever you want (relating to the question)
- Example questions from paper 2:
  + Referring to two of the works you have studied, discuss both how and why the text invites the reader to identify with situations, characters and/or ideas.
