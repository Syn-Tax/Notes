  abstract = {Africa will account for 80 percent of the projected 4 billion increase in the global population by 2100. The accompanying increase in its working age population creates a window of opportunity, which if properly harnessed, can translate into higher growth and yield a demographic dividend. We quantify the potential demographic dividend based on the experience of other regions. The dividend will vary across countries, depending on such factors as the initial working age population as well as the speed and magnitude of demographic transition. It will be critical to ensure that the right supportive policies, including those fostering human capital accumulation and job creation, are in place to translate this opportunity into concrete economic growth.},

  abstract = {The demographic dividend can be defined as the potential economic benefit offered by changes in the age structure of the population, during the demographic transition, when there is an increase in working-age population and an associated decline in the dependent age population. Bangladesh is also going through the demographic transition, and is experiencing a once-in-a-lifetime demographic dividend as the working-age population bulges and the dependency ratio declines For obtaining timing of demographic dividend, growth rate of labour force and population, and demographic support ratio have been utilized using UN World Population Prospects(2010 Revision) data. All the indicators support the view that the 1st demographic dividend starts in 1980 and continues for a period of 60 years up to 2040. The level and trend of important measures of fertility, mortality , dependency ratio and support ratio over the period 1950-2011. The possibility of a second dividend arises because some of the gains in per capita income can be diverted to raising productivity and thereby raising standard of living for future generations. This outcome can be generalized in a variety of ways. One important possibility is by increasing investment in human capital. Increase in investment in physical capital should also be emphasized. For economic benefits to materialize, there is a need for policies dealing with education, public health, and those that promote labour market flexibility and provide incentives for investment and savings. On the contrary, if appropriate policies are not formulated, the demographic dividend might, in fact, be a cost, leading to unemployment and an unbearable strain on education, health, and old age security.},

  abstract = {Demographers and economists have become increasingly interested in the nature and significance of changes in the age-structure of populations as they shift from being relatively `youthful' to relatively `old'. This is not just because they worry about the consequences of the later phases in this transition, but also because they see benefits or opportunities in the preceding phases. Demographers and economists have, however, taken rather different views of the demographic dividends or bonuses which have been associated with certain kinds of age-structural transition. This paper highlights important features of the transition process too much neglected by economists.},
