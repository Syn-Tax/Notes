- there is a difference between an assertion and a proposition
  + Assertion - linguistic act either spoken or written that has a truth value
  + Proposition - the content of your assertion i.e. th eunderlying meaning of what your saying
  + Truth value - the state of being true or false or indeterninate
  + Assertion changea with language however proposition doesn't
