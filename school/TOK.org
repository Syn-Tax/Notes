* Knowledge & the Knower
- underpinned by the question how do we know stuff
** What criteria can we use to distinguish between knowledge, belief & opinion?
3 things that we feel we know

- terms about knowledge are really well defined
- there is a difference between an assertion and a proposition
  + Assertion - linguistic act either spoken or written that has a truth value
  + Proposition - the content of your assertion i.e. th eunderlying meaning of what your saying
  + Truth value - the state of being true or false or indeterninate
  + Assertion changea with language however proposition doesn't
- Belief is when you take a propositional attitude is truth (i.e. you think it is true)
- the traditional def. of knowledge is justified belief
- Justification - evidence or other support of belief
- testimony - taking someone's word for it
  + i.e. books or new reports
- First person experience is somewhat self explanatory
- Gettier cases - situations in which you can have justified true beliefs but accidentally and therefore is not knowledge
