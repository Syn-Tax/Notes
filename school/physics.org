* Things to remember
diameter of an atom ~ 1*10^-10m
diameter of a neucleus ~ 1*10^-15
* Measurement
** Estimation
*** Piano Tuners in Fife?
1000 pianos tuned 6 months 3 per day
20 +- 20
actual about 3 ish.
Still within an order of magnitude
*** Mass of the earth?
23000 km circumference 4000km radius

volume ~ 2.56*10^11 km^3

density ~ 1025 kg/m^3

volume ~ 2.56*10^20 m^3
mass ~ 2.6*10^23kg
*** Mass of the sun?
r ~ 700.000 km

V ~ 1.3*10^18 km^3
V ~ 1.3*10^27 m^3

m ~ 2*10^30
*** Mass of the Observable universe?
2*10^31

10^22

2*10^53
*** Number of atoms in a glass of water?
300g
mass = Mr * mol
300 = 18 * mol
mol = 50/3 * 6.02214*10^23
=> atoms ~ 3*10^25
*** Number of glasses of water in the world's oceans?
1*10^9 km^3
=> m^3 = 1*10^18
glass of water ~ 0.3 m^3

glasses of water in the ocean ~ 3*10^18
*** Surface area of the earth?
4*pi*r^2
r = 6000 km

SA = 6*10^8
** Uncertainty
*** height in inches?
1 inch = 2.541 cm
180 cm

- There is some uncertainty coming from a difficulty in measuring
*** Expressing uncertainties
(182 +- 1) cm or 182cm +- 1cm

- The number of decimal places in the uncertainty must equal the precision of the number

A field has a width of 20+-1 m and a length of 120+-3 m what is its area and perimiter?
Area = 2400+-183 or 2400+-180 m^2
Perimiter =  280+-8 m
*** Adding/subtracting uncertainties
- x + y = z OR x - y = z
  delta z = uncertainty in z
  We often use error in place of uncertainty
- delta z = delta x + delta y (for both addition and subtraction)
- We always add the absolute (in this case as a number as opposed to relative uncertainty (5%)) uncertainties for addition/subtraction
*** Multiplying/dividing uncertainties
[[https://i.imgur.com/lIPTy8z.png]]
- they are usually expressed as percentages so they are relative to the value
*** Uncertainty propogation for exponents
[[https://i.imgur.com/cMep6ZD.png]]
*** Implicit uncertainties
If no uncertainty is given, it will still be implied by the number of sig. figs.
*** Uncertainty in questions
- even if the question is not about uncertainties you should still express to the right amount of sig. figs.
- The simpler rule to use ofr a question which is not about uncertainties
  + for mult/div/powers the smaller number of sig. figs. in the question
  + for add/sub the least number of d.p. given in the question
- More complex functions
  Sometimes we need to go back to first principles
  + What is the uncertainty of sin(30+/-1 degrees)? for example
*** Experimental Uncertainties
GENERAL REMARKS
- Variables should be tightly defined in experiments
  + i.e. not 'length of pendulum', but 'length of pendulum, as measured from the centre of rotation to the centre of the mass'

TYPES OF ERRORS
- *Systematic error* - the error is consistently wrong for all measurements in the same direction e.g. units, parallax error when measuring, zero errors (rulers, balances)
- *Random Error* - an error which is random
- *Reading error* - usually half of the smallest division

ACCURACY & PRESICION
- Accurate measurements are close to the true value. They have low systematic error
- Repeated readings of precise measurements have the same value, they have low random error
** Units
- mechanical horsepower
- coulomb per second
- We only use about 6-7 base units
- we use the SI units
  + In the SI system there are 7 fundamental units
    - metres (m)
    - seconds (s)
    - kilogram (kg)
    - kelvin (K)
    - Amperes (A)
    - mole (mol)
    - candela (cd)
  + These units are defined in terms of physical constants
  + All remaining units are derived units
  + Joule in terms of fundamental units
    - kg * c^2
** Scalars & Vectors
A *scalar* is a quantity what has a *magnitude* but no direction
A *vector* is a quantity what has both *magnitude* and direction

*** Distance & Displacement
- *Distance* is scalar, *displacement* is vector

Is the shortest path moved in a particular direction

- if you run around a running track your distance will be 400m but your displacement will be 0m
**** Measuring distance/displacement
- Resolution is the smallest change an instrument can detect increasing resolution generally improves presicion
- The precision is how close together repeat measurements are
- The accuracy is how close to the true value a measurement is
*** Speed & Veolcity
- *Speed* is scalar, *velocity* is vector
- How do you calculate speed?
        Speed = Distance/time
- What is the difference between *instantaneous* and *average* velocity/speed
  + instantaneous speed is speed at a specific moment
  + Average is over a non-zero amount of time
**** Measuring Speed & Veolcity
1) Simple method
   Stopwatch & measuring rule

   Problems:
   - there is a large uncertainty in the amount of time
   - large uncertainty in distance
2) To reduce uncertainty in time use light gates - average speed
3) Instantaneous speed with light gates
* Forces
** Motion Graphs and acceleration
*** Starter
1) 0
2) 0
3) 100 km
4) 20km/h
*** Acceleration
*_Uniform Acceleration_* (Uniform = doesn't change)

- Acceleration is a measure of how much speed (or velocity) changes per unit time
  [[https://i.imgur.com/NQJ4VM6.png]]
- Unit of acceleration is usually ms^-2
- Unit of velocity is usually ms^-1
- Unit of time is usually s

- *THIS EQUATION ONLY WORKS WHEN ACCELERATION IS UNIFORM*
- e.g. a car accelerates from rest, for 10s the acceleration is 5ms^-2. What is the final velocity of the car?
*** Non-uniform Acceleration
In real life, acceleration is not normally uniform (constant).

Instantaneous velocity is defined as displacement/time when time is a very small number
i.e.
[[https://i.imgur.com/k491Sz9.png]]

From a distance time graph, velocity is the gradient of the graph at a point. Similar for a velocity time graph the gradient will be acceleration
*** Displacement time graphs
- For a displacement time graph, velocity is the gradient of the graph at a point.
