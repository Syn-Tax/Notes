*** Teaching Polly
I feel that teaching Polly went very well, we mostly sailed around different marks (Callum setup a really bad course so lots of close marks). She thinks she will be able to sail around the course next time and then be on her own.
*** Myself
I think that I need to concentrate more on my spacial awareness and finding gusts rather than talking to Polly.
