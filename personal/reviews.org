***** GCSE Results
Today was the day that i got the majority of my GCSE results see the table below.
| Subject            | Grade |
|--------------------+-------|
| English Language   |     7 |
| English Literature |     7 |
| French             |     6 |
| Latin              |     6 |
| Geography          |     8 |
| Maths              |     9 |
| CS                 |     9 |
| Combined Science   |   9-9 |

I personally am very happy with these results especially english as i consistently got 6s throughout the years.
***** New Laptop
Due to these results my parents have agreed to add 500 pounds to the laptop stockpile and this has allowed me to upgrade it from the ryzen 3 4300u to the ryzen 5 4500u lenovo flex 5 which will be picked up tomorrow. The interesting thing is that many people have said that the laptop will come with a pen and others have said that it won't, therefore we will see what happens.
